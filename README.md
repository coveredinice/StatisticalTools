# Statistical Tools
A very small set of tools used for statistical model evaluation. Written in MATLAB. The code should be pretty straight-forward. 

# Usage
Open the file you're interested in, write your data in the correct section, execute the relevant parts of the code. That's basically it.

# Acknowledgements
Done as a personal project after I successfully completed a course in <i>Data-design and nature-inspired computing</i> at Ca'Foscari University of Venice, as part of my Master's in Computer Science. Gaia O. and Gianluca C. helped me along the way. Use the code as you see fit, a link back is appreciated but not requested.
