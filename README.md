# Statistical Tools
A very small set of tools used for statistical model evaluation. Written in MATLAB. The code should be pretty straight-forward. 

# Usage
Open the file you're interested in, write your data in the correct section, execute the relevant parts of the code. That's basically it. The available tools are:

<ul>
  <li>Simple comparison (with various assumptions on the variances of the data); </li>
  <li>1-way and 2-way ANOVA;</li>
  <li>Block design;</li>
  <li>Regression evaluation (single Beta parameter or whole model);</li>
  <li>Latin Square design.</li>
  
</ul>

# Acknowledgements
Done as a personal project after I successfully completed a course in <i>Data-design and nature-inspired computing</i> at Ca'Foscari University of Venice, as part of my Master's in Computer Science. Gaia O. and Gianluca C. helped me along the way. Use the code as you see fit, a link back is appreciated but not requested.
